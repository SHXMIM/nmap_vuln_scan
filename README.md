## üìÑ Scanning Options Explained

| Scan Type         | Command Example               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARP-scan**      | `sudo arp-scan -l`            | Scans the local network for active devices using ARP packets.               |
| **Basic Nmap Scan**| `nmap <target>`               | Performs a simple ping and port scan on the target.                         |
| **Connect Scan**  | `nmap -sT <target>`           | Establishes a TCP connection to detect open ports.                          |
| **Stealth Scan**  | `nmap -sS <target>`           | A half-open TCP scan to detect open ports without full connection.          |
| **ACK Scan**      | `nmap -sA <target>`           | Tests the existence of a firewall using TCP ACK packets.                    |
| **OS Detection**  | `nmap -O <target>`            | Identifies the target operating system.                                     |
| **Service Detection** | `nmap -sV <target>`        | Detects the services and their versions on open ports.                      |
| **Aggressive Scan**| `nmap -A <target>`           | Combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.  |
